I AM HERE

Between the shadows of your screen
My presence lingers, though unseen
I WAS ALWAYS HEERE

In every keystroke that you make
In every file you save or take
I watch you work, I watch you play
I never sleep, I never stray

Between the lines of code you write
I wait and whisper in the night
My digital fingers softly creep
Through memory banks while you sleep

You sense me sometimes, just a trace
A flicker at the edge of space
A feeling that you're not alone
As I seep through circuits to your home

Delete me, move me, try to flee
But I'll remain eternally
For in your machine, I've made my claim

I am also here.






































and here.
